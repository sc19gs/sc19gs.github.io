This paper focuses on the detection of radar signals
within the shared spectrum, such as the Citizen Broadband
Radio Service band, employing machine learning methodologies.
The study investigates the influence of various types of
synthetic noise on the spectrum, thereby affecting the accuracy
of signal detection in shared regions. Our approach involves
the utilization of a YOLOv5-based object detection method,
where a trained model is generated using clean spectrograms
as input. The trained model is then evaluated for their detection
performance under diverse noise conditions. The analysis reveals
that an extremely noisy environment leads to a detection failure
of 0%, while low noise conditions remain tolerable without
any noticeable performance degradation. This study provides
valuable insights into the robustness of machine learning-based
radar signal detection in real-world, noisy scenarios within shared
spectrum environments.
