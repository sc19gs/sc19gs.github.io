This study presents a comparative analysis of various types of communication latency in networked robotic setup. We consider three distinct communication link: Robot-to-Robot (R2R), Network-to-Robot (N2R), and Robot-to-Network (R2N) for enabling communication within a swarm of robots. To conduct our study we design an experimental testbed in a laboratory setup featuring a grid layout with strategically placed obstacles emulating a warehouse scenario. We use two different type of state-of-the-art experimental robots, transmitting multimedia data using the frequency bands 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. Our experimental results indicate that the R2R communication using 5 GHz frequency achieves the lowest average latency of 0.4 milliseconds, compared to the other types of communication.
