A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical object, system, or process that is used to simulate, predict, and optimize its performance in real-time. This digital counterpart is created using data from sensors and other sources to reflect the state and behavior of the physical counterpart. In this demo paper, we introduce an innovative real-time object localization system within a digital twin, designed to detect and locate objects within an environment. We demonstrate our system using a digital twin setup that leverages Blender tool and RF propagation with NVIDIA’s Sionna RT. Our results illustrate that real-time object localization can be effectively achieved through our framework. This demo offers valuable insights into the potential of our framework as a reliable and efficient method for performing real-time object localization.
